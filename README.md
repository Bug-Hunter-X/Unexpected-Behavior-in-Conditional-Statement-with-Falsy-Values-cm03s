# Unexpected Behavior in Conditional Statement with Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving incorrect handling of falsy values in conditional statements. The bug arises from using strict equality (`===`) in a conditional statement without explicitly handling various falsy values such as `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `false`, and empty strings (`''`).

## Bug Description
The function `foo` is designed to add two numbers, but it only explicitly checks for `0` as a falsy value. If either `a` or `b` is another falsy value such as `null` or `undefined`, the function does not produce the correct result, and this may cause errors. This leads to unexpected behavior and may cause the program to throw an error, as shown in the example. 

## Solution
The solution involves changing the conditional statement to explicitly check for all potential falsy values using a loose comparison (`==`) or by using a more robust method for handling falsy values, such as optional chaining or nullish coalescing. This ensures that the function handles all cases correctly. See the `bugSolution.js` file for a fixed version of the code.
